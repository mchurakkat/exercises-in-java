# Exercises solution with Java :coffee:

This is solution for a couple of exercises done with **Java** programming language.

## Exercises 
1. A pedestrian traffic light is given. At the beginning of each hour, for 3 minutes it displays the green color, then for 2 minutes it is red, continuing to run like this for the whole hour.

A time t (in minutes) is entered from the keypad. Determine what color the traffic light is at time t.


E.g: t = 14
output: red
3 minutes green, 2 minutes red, 3 min green, 2 min red, 3 min green, 1 minute red


2. An array of numbers is given, which is called ‘numbers’ and an integer ‘k’.

Find the subsequence of numbers, of length k, that has the largest sum of elements.

A subsequence is a list (array) derived from the original list by deleting some elements, or by keeping all elements, but without changing the order of the remaining elements.
 
 
E.g:
numbers = [2, 1, 3, 3]
k = 2
output: [3, 3]

numbers = [-2, -9, 3, 7]
k = 3
output = [-2, 3, 7]
